    Our academic mission is to be a preeminent business school recognized for scholarly research, 
    teaching excellence, and innovative curricula;focused on the responsible management of organizations in the global environment.
     We educate our students to become leaders who are critical thinkers, ethically informed, and globally aware.
     We value profits, but on top of them, we also value how they are made. 
    That’s why we’re adding a new dimension to how we measure success: not just in profits and power, 
    but also in responsibility and its integral role in shaping society.</p>
